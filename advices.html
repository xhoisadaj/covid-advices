            <h1>What are the benefits of vaccination</h1>

            <p>
              Getting vaccinated could save your life. COVID-19 vaccines provide
              strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and
              death. There is also some evidence that being vaccinated will make
              it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which
              means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even after getting vaccinated, keep taking precautions to protect
              yourself, family, friends and anyone else you may come into
              contact with. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but some
              people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination. There
              is also still a chance that you could also pass the virus on to
              others who are not vaccinated.
