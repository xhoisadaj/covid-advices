              How does COVID-19 spread between people?

              <p>
                We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
                which spreads between people in several different ways. Current
                evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people
                who are in close contact with each other, for example at a
                conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected
                person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they
                cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then
                contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through
                the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called
                short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if
                infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes,
                nose, or mouth (droplet transmission). The virus can also spread
                in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where
                people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because
                aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than
                conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol
                or long-range airborne transmission). People may also become
                infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching
                surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus.
                Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of
                the virus and which settings are most risky and why. Research is
                also under way to study virus variants that are emerging and why
                some are more transmissible. For updated information on
                SARS-CoV-2 variants, please read the weekly epidemiologic
                updates.

              When do infected people transmit the virus?

                Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be
                contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people.
                Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most
                infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days
                before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People
                who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer. While
                someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to
                others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and
                more research is needed in this area.

              How can I reduce my risk of getting COVID-19?

                There are many things you can do to keep yourself and your loved
                ones safe from COVID-19. Know your risks to lower risks. Follow
                these basic precautions: Follow local guidance: Check to see
                what national, regional and local authorities are advising so
                you have the most relevant information for where you are. Keep
                your distance: Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if
                they don’t appear to be sick, since people can have the virus
                without having symptoms. Wear a mask: Wear a well-fitting
                three-layer mask, especially when you can’t physically distance,
                or if you’re indoors. Clean your hands before putting on and
                taking off a mask. Read our Masks and COVID-19 Q&A and watch our
                videos on how to wear and make masks. Avoid crowded places,
                poorly ventilated, indoor locations and avoid prolonged contact
                with others. Spend more time outdoors than indoors. Ventilation
                is important: Open windows when indoors to increase the amount
                of outdoor air. Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public
                settings or health facilities, in case people infected with
                COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with
                standard disinfectants. Frequently clean your hands with soap
                and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you can, carry
                alcohol-based rub with you and use it often. Cover your coughs
                and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing used tissues
                into a closed bin right away. Then wash your hands or use an
                alcohol-based hand rub. Get vaccinated: When it’s your turn, get
                vaccinated. Follow local guidance and recommendations about
                vaccination.
